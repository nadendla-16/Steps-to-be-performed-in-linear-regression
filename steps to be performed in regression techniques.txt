1)read train and test
2)concatenate them
3)data preparation
4)null value handling
5)split train and test again
6)split train into train1 and train2
7)apply linear regression model on x_train1 and y_train1
10)list train1 coefficients
11)predict on train2
12)find error between y_train2 and predicted IR on train2
13)then apply linear regression model on whole train set
14)predict on test set and export results in excel sheet

ridge:
14)take 100 random lambda values between 1 and 100
15)model = ridge
16)put all this in grid search cv with model as ridge, cv as 5 or 10, above lambda values and scoring method as mean abs error
17)apply model on train data
18)get the best estimator

19)get grid search cv results
20)report top n results
21)predict results on test data    
22)list train1 coefficients
